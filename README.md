This is my Trending in the World Projects. 

It is a webapp that lets users click anywhere on a world map to see what is trending on Twitter in that region. I used node.js for the backend proxy server, express for the backend framework, Javascript for the frontend, Google API for the maps, and Twitter API for the trending tweets.
